Update 1; 8/8/24:
Create a UI for game.

Create structure using HTML, style with CSS.

Using DOM manipulation with JavaScript, create
dynamic functionality so game can be played
by pressing on buttons, with a fully working
visual game window.

Win/Lose logic will stay the same, but now
the score will be tracked and shown on the screen
for both the player and the computer.

The game will no longer be played in the console.

----------------------------------------------
This is a very simple rock paper scissors game.

It will be played completely in the console.

Other than the basic skeleton HTML, this will be
made completely using JavaScript.

The player will make a choice through a prompt, then
the computer's choice will be made using the random
method.

The game will be played until either the Player or the
Computer gets 5 wins. Then the page will need to be
refreshed in order to play again.
