This is a very simple rock paper scissors game.

It will be played completely in the console.

Other than the basic skeleton HTML, this will be
made completely using JavaScript.

The player will make a choice through a prompt, then
the computer's choice will be made using the random
method.

The game will be played until either the Player or the
Computer gets 5 wins. Then the page will need to be
refreshed in order to play again.
