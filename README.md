This is a very simple rock paper scissors game.

It will be played completely in the console.

Other than the basic skeleton HTML, this will be
made completely using JavaScript.

The player will make a choice through a prompt, then
the computer's choice will be made using the random
method.

There will only be a single turn, then the page will
need to be reloaded to play again.
